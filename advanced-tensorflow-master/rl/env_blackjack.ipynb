    "- Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to obtain cards that sum to as near as possible to 21 without going over.  They're playing against a fixed dealer.\n",
    "- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have point value 10. \n",
    "- Aces can either count as 11 or 1, and it's called 'usable' at 11.\n",
    "- This game is placed with an infinite deck (or with replacement).\n",
    "- The game starts with each (player and dealer) having one face up and one face down card.\n",
    "- The player can request additional cards (hit=1) until they decide to stop (stick=0) or exceed 21 (bust).\n",
    "- After the player sticks, the dealer reveals their facedown card, and draws until their sum is 17 or greater.  If the dealer goes bust the player wins. \n",
    "- If neither player nor dealer busts, the outcome (win, lose, draw) is decided by whose sum is closer to 21.  \n",
    "- The reward for winning is +1, drawing is 0, and losing is -1.\n",
    "- The observation of a 3-tuple of: the players current sum, the dealer's one showing card (1-10 where 1 is ace), and whether or not the player holds a usable ace (0 or 1).\n",
    "- This environment corresponds to the version of the blackjack problem described in Example 5.1 in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto (1998).\n",
